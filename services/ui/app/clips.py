"""The reference-clip store: what "use my own voice" actually writes.

WHAT A VOICE IS, ON THIS STACK. Chatterbox has no named voices; it clones from
a reference clip, and `generate(audio_prompt_path=...)` takes a FILESYSTEM
PATH. tts-long turns that into a registry -- TTS_VOICE_DIR/gabriel.wav is the
voice "gabriel" -- and there is no per-request reference field on the wire at
any layer: `job["reference"]` is filled only from Registry.resolve() and is
explicitly stripped from every /jobs response (main.py:563). So making a clip
usable means putting a file in that directory, and nothing else.

WHY THE STORE LIVES HERE AND NOT IN tts-long. Two reasons, and the second is
the load-bearing one.

  * This is where the multipart already arrives. The browser is the transcoder
    (see below), so by the time bytes reach a server they are already a WAV of
    known duration, and the work left is a sanitise-write-validate-unlink
    sequence with no audio library in it.
  * tts-long is a 6.5 GB image with torch in it. Adding python-multipart, an
    upload route and a delete route to the process that holds Chatterbox, to
    serve a browser feature, puts a write path into the heaviest and slowest-
    to-rebuild container in the estate. A named volume costs nothing and this
    service is the only writer: tts-long mounts the same volume READ-ONLY.

The one change tts-long does need is small and is justified on its own terms
rather than by this feature: its registry scanned the directory once at start,
so a file copied in by ANY means -- this service, scp, a TrueNAS share --
needed a container restart to be seen. It now rescans when the directory's
mtime changes. See services/tts-long/app/voices.py.

THE SEQUENCE IS devnen/Chatterbox-TTS-Server's, MIT, server.py:670-753,
transplanted in shape rather than in code: sanitise the name, enforce an
extension allowlist, write, validate the duration against a ceiling, unlink on
failure, and answer with per-item errors alongside the refreshed list. Three
things are added that upstream lacks and that matter once it sits behind a
gateway: a size cap, a collision policy, and a name derived from a whitelist
rather than from the uploaded filename -- upstream's `sanitize_filename` is the
only thing between a caller and path traversal, and "the only thing" is not
where a write path belongs.

WHY WAV ONLY, when tts-long's registry accepts .wav .flac .mp3 .ogg .m4a
.opus. Because the browser transcodes everything to WAV before it is sent:
MediaRecorder produces `audio/webm;codecs=opus` on Chrome and Firefox and
`audio/mp4` on Safari, neither of which is safely in that set, and a webm
renamed .ogg does not decode. AudioContext.decodeAudioData ->
OfflineAudioContext at 24 kHz mono -> a hand-written WAV header is about fifty
lines of vanilla JS, needs no dependency on either side, and means the server
receives one format it is certain to read -- which is also what lets the
validation below be the stdlib `wave` module rather than librosa.

# converted in the browser before it could be stored at all.
#
# That made the browser a hard dependency for format support, and it is not a
# reliable one: an ogg/opus file from a phone often carries no duration in its
# container, and decodeAudioData handled one by returning a single second of
# audio and no error. A 1.0 s reference clip is useless and looked like a
# successful upload.
#
# So the original bytes are stored when the browser cannot make sense of them,

    requested came back as 25.97 and thirty came back as 36. The ceiling was

    exceeding it, and the error told the user their clip was too long for a
    length they had not chosen.

    Trimming rather than refusing also makes the two import paths agree. The
    browser's toWav has always trimmed to the ceiling instead of rejecting; the
    server refusing was the odd one out.
