"""The page, and the three things a browser cannot do for itself.

    GET  /ui                       the page: one HTML file, no build step
    GET  /ui/config                what the page needs to boot, no secrets
    GET  /ui/clips  POST  DELETE   the reference-clip store (voice cloning)
    POST /ui/resolve /commit
         /abandon  /fetch          MeTube ingestion -- see app/ingest.py
    GET  /ui/progress
    everything else in the table   forwarded verbatim to the gateway

WHY THIS IS A FIFTH CONTAINER AND NOT THREE ROUTES ON THE GATEWAY. The survey
argued for the latter and the argument was good: the page is 8 KB of static
markup, the gateway is already the only published port, and the whole estate
is organised around not adding a container. It is a fifth container because
the brief asked for `services/ui` with a Containerfile, a compose entry, a
workflow matrix row and a README like its four siblings -- and because the
gateway's Containerfile makes a specific promise this feature would break:
283 MB, "the cheap check on this file", no dependency that is not fastapi,
httpx or uvicorn. Ingestion needs yt-dlp, and yt-dlp in the gateway makes the
process that holds every API key also the process that spawns a subprocess on
a URL a browser chose. Separate images keep that blast radius where it is.

WHAT IT COSTS, HONESTLY: a second published port. compose.yaml's own comment
says "if a second `ports` entry ever appears here, this file has stopped doing
its job", and it is right about backend ports -- 8000, 8001 and 8002 are what
that sentence was written about, and they stay closed. This one is a browser
origin, not a bypass: it reaches the gateway and nothing else, it forwards the
caller's Authorization or adds its own, and it can answer nothing the gateway
would not have answered. It is still not a bypass -- but with
UI_GATEWAY_API_KEY set it IS the authenticator, which is the paragraph further
down.

WHY THE PAGE'S XHRs COME BACK HERE RATHER THAN GOING STRAIGHT TO :30080. One
origin means no CORS on the gateway, no preflight on every upload, and no
second base URL for someone to get wrong. The forwarding table below is a
FIXED allowlist -- there is no wildcard and no catch-all, for the same reason
the gateway has none: a wildcard would proxy /docs and /openapi.json to
services that deliberately do not publish them.

AUTHENTICATION, AND THE BOUNDARY THAT MOVED. This service still compares no
token and holds no key LIST -- the gateway is the only thing that decides
whether a credential is good. What changed is who presents one.

It used to be the browser. The page kept a key in localStorage, put it on every
XHR, and this service forwarded it untouched; :30080 was the trust boundary and
this container was a pipe. It is now UI_GATEWAY_API_KEY on this container, and
this process adds the header on the way past, because the user's decision is
that this is not a bring-your-own-key tool. There is no key box on the page any
more and nothing for a screenshot or a shared laptop to give away.

STATE THE CONSEQUENCE RATHER THAN LET IT BE DISCOVERED: the trust boundary is
now :30081. Anyone who can reach this port is authenticated by this service,
because it signs their requests for them. On a LAN behind a firewall that is a
reasonable trade for a tool one person uses. It is not one anywhere else, and
publishing 30081 more widely than 30080 now grants MORE access rather than
less. See services/ui/README.md's security section.

UI_GATEWAY_API_KEY is unset by default, like GATEWAY_API_KEYS, and unset means
no header is added and an inbound one is forwarded exactly as before -- so the
current keyless deployment is byte-for-byte unchanged. The routes that are ours
-- ingestion, clips -- still ask the gateway whether the credential in play is
good, by making the cheapest authenticated call it has, `GET /v1/models`, which
it answers from a static table without touching a backend.

# 404 here exactly as it is at the gateway.
#
# /v1/audio/translations IS PRESENT NOW, AND THE ENTRY THIS REPLACES EXPLAINS
# WHY IT WAS NOT: "the gateway does not route it and Parakeet refuses
# translation anyway". Both halves were true and neither was a reason. stt-stack
# has answered POST /v1/audio/translations all along, with the same field
# validation the transcription route has, and a deployment running
# STT_MODEL=whisper answers it for real -- so the table was hiding a working
# feature on the strength of which checkpoint happened to be loaded. Under
# Parakeet the request now reaches stt-stack's own 400, which names the engine
# and the variable that changes it; that is an answer a caller can act on and a
# 404 from this table is not. DELETE /jobs/{id} is present for the mirror-image
# reason: tts-long has had that route all along (main.py:580) and only the
# gateway's route table was missing it -- which is why the Jobs tab can offer
# "stop and keep what's done" rather than a job that cannot be called off.
#
# CHOOSING THE SPEECH ENGINE ADDS NOTHING HERE, and that is a fact about this
# table rather than an oversight in it. The engine is a `model` field in the
# body of POST /v1/audio/speech and POST /jobs, both already listed, so a
# second engine reaches the page without this service being rebuilt. If an
# engine ever moves into a path -- /v1/audio/speech/{engine}, a per-engine job
# route -- it needs a line here, a route at the gateway and a route at the
# backend, and missing any one of the three is a 405 in the browser and a line
# in no log. services/gateway/tests/test_gateway.py asserts both halves of
# that: the three speech paths are present, and no engine-shaped path is.
#
# A THIRD ENGINE PROVED IT, INCLUDING THE ONE WITH TWENTY FIXED VOICES. An
# engine whose speakers are baked into the weights has a voice list this table
# cannot serve, and the obvious move -- routing tts-long's own GET /voices --
# is the wrong one twice over. `("GET", "/voices")` below is tts-stack's, one
# path answered by two backends, so a second entry cannot be spelled at all
# without inventing a prefix and the rewriting rule that goes with it. The
# preset names arrive instead on the health body the page already polls:
# /ui/health -> the gateway's /health -> tts-long's own, inlined at each hop by
# `response.json()` and never summarised, so `engines[*].voices` reaches the
# browser verbatim with no line here and no line in the gateway's table.
# WHICHEVER HOP STARTS PICKING KEYS OUT OF THAT BODY BREAKS THE VOICE PICKER
# AND NOTHING ELSE: no route 404s, no allowlist changes, no log line differs --
# the engine's group simply renders empty and the page offers a shorter list
# than the stack has. So neither hop may summarise `health`; it is the
# backend's own document, inlined whole. The gateway's half of that is pinned
# by test_the_engine_detail_tts_long_publishes_reaches_the_caller_verbatim in
# services/gateway/tests/test_gateway.py; this half is `response.json()` in
# `health` below, and it must stay that and not a field list.
