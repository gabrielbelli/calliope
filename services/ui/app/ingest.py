"""Resolve, confirm, fetch -- and never in a different order.

    POST /ui/resolve   guard -> MeTube /add auto_start:false -> probe
    POST /ui/commit    MeTube /start (or re-add, when a clip range was chosen)
    POST /ui/abandon   MeTube /delete from BOTH queues, then verify
    GET  /ui/progress  MeTube /history, as percent / speed / eta
    POST /ui/fetch     MeTube's file -> multipart -> gateway -> stt-stack
    POST /ui/captions  MeTube's .vtt/.srt -> the page. NO stt CALL AT ALL
    GET  /ui/media     MeTube's finished file -> the browser, byte ranges and all

/ui/media IS THE ONE ROUTE HERE THAT SENDS MEDIA DOWNWARDS, and it is opt-in at
every step rather than a hole in the design above. Everything else in this file
exists so that a two-hour podcast costs this laptop a transcript and not
131 MB; that stays the default and nothing fetches on its own. What /ui/media
adds is that the file MeTube has ALREADY downloaded can be played back, on
demand, when someone presses play -- which is what makes the caption band and
the karaoke highlight work for a link at all. Before it, both features were
upload-only and every screenshot the user sends is a pasted link.

WHY IT MUST BE THIS SERVICE THAT SERVES THE BYTES. MeTube emits no CORS headers
of any kind -- CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS is empty, on_prepare returns early, and its
socket.io server was built with cors_allowed_origins=[] -- so a browser cannot
fetch from port 30097 whatever the user does. Verified live.

AND WHY IT IS A RELAY RATHER THAN A RANGE SERVER. MeTube's static route already
does ranges properly: `Range: bytes=0-1023` came back `206 Partial Content`
with `Content-Range: bytes 0-1023/533915`, `Accept-Ranges: bytes` and
`Content-Type: video/mp4`. Parsing ranges here would be a second, worse
implementation of something already correct one hop away, and it would have to
agree with aiohttp about every edge -- an open-ended range, a range past the
end, a stale If-Range. So the header goes up untouched and the answer comes
back untouched.

NOTHING IS DOWNLOADED BEFORE THE USER SAYS SO, which is the requirement the
user pressed hardest on. `auto_start:false` on /add resolves the URL and parks
it; only /start moves bytes; /delete abandons it. All three verified against
MeTube's source and live against the running instance.

WHY /add COMES BEFORE THE PROBE, when probing first would be tidier. Because
POST /add is where MeTube's url_guard runs, and that guard is better than ours:
ingress validation plus a connect-time getaddrinfo hook inside the download
subprocess, so it also covers redirects and DNS rebinding. Putting our
subprocess first would make our own forty-line pre-filter the only thing that
had run before a URL was handed to yt-dlp.

THE COST OF THAT ORDERING, NAMED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER. Every link the
user declines has already left a pending record in MeTube. So /ui/abandon is
not a nicety, it is the other half of /ui/resolve, and it is tested -- see
tests/test_ingest.py::test_abandon_reaps_a_declined_link. MeTube's /delete
answers {"status":"ok"} when it deletes nothing at all, so abandoning re-reads
/history and reports whether the record actually went.

THE ESTIMATES ARE NOT COMPUTED HERE, deliberately. This module returns FACTS --
title, duration, the size of the audio-only stream, is_live, whether real
subtitles exist -- and the page does the arithmetic with the realtime factor it
has measured on this box. Two reasons. The rate is a moving number the browser
keeps an EMA of from every transcription it runs, and a server-side estimate
would be a second, staler copy of it. And the download half and the transcribe
half are NEVER blended into one figure: for long media the download is the slow
half, and one merged number hides which half to blame when it drags.

    THE PART THAT MATTERS IS THE RANGE, not the streaming. A <video> or

    ignores Range and answers 200 with the whole file, it plays from the start
    and every scrub is silently ignored -- the picture moves back to zero and
    the user concludes the player is broken. So the header goes up and the 206
    comes back, and this function parses neither.

    WHY THE ANSWER IS NOT SIMPLY PROXIED. Three things are checked first, and
    each one is the boundary for a different failure:

      * MeTube must already hold a FINISHED record for this token. That is what
        "only a token this page actually resolved" means in practice, and it is
        the same gate /ui/fetch and /ui/captions apply. Without it this route
        is an open read of anything in someone else's download directory, by a
        name a caller supplies.
      * The filename must be media. A .vtt served as video/mp4 is a confusing
        failure; a name that got past the suffix check is one this route
        refuses rather than relays.
      * The whole file must be inside MAX_MEDIA_BYTES. See config: it is
        deliberately its own setting and not MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES, which bounds
        what services/stt reads into memory rather than what a laptop pulls
        down a domestic line.

    NO guard.check ON THE TOKEN HERE, and that is deliberate rather than an
    omission. guard.check resolves the hostname, and a single playback makes
    dozens of range requests -- one getaddrinfo each would be a DNS lookup per
    scrub for a URL that is never fetched on this path, only looked up in a
    dictionary. The URL was guarded twice before anything was downloaded, by
    /ui/resolve and by MeTube's own url_guard, and the /history lookup below is
    what proves this is that same link.
