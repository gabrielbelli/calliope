"""Five scalars out of a URL, and not one byte of media.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, given that the whole point of this service is to
delegate downloading to MeTube rather than embed a downloader.

MeTube resolves the metadata and then throws it away. `__extract_info`
(ytdl.py:1570) calls `extract_info(url, download=False)` on every POST /add
regardless of auto_start, so the full yt-dlp info-dict -- duration,
filesize_approx, per-format audio sizes, all of it -- exists inside MeTube for
a moment. It is stored as `self.entry` and then deliberately stripped on the
way out: `_PUBLIC_EXCLUDED_FIELDS = ("entry", "subtitle_files")` (ytdl.py:521).
`DownloadInfo` (ytdl.py:461-501) has no duration field anywhere in MeTube's
source, and `self.size` stays None until os.path.getsize fills it AFTER the
download finishes (ytdl.py:1065).

So a pending MeTube entry gives you a title and a live_status. The brief's
whole requirement -- "title, duration and size, with the estimated
transcription time" -- is computed from the one field MeTube never exposes.

A PROBE IS NOT A DOWNLOADER, and the difference is enumerable rather than
rhetorical. This has no output template, no writable directory, no format
selection, no post-processing chain, no cookie jar, no concurrency, no retry
policy, no resume, no progress reporting and no disk. It runs once, for at
most PROBE_TIMEOUT seconds, and produces at most a few hundred bytes of JSON
that are parsed into five values. Everything MeTube absorbed, it keeps.

THE HONEST COST, because it is a real one. This is a second yt-dlp to keep
current and it rots on the same weekly schedule as MeTube's. Three things
blunt it:

  * It runs THIRD, only on a URL that our own guard and then MeTube's
    url_guard have both already accepted. It is never the thing that decides
    whether a URL is fetchable.
  * It resolves the host AGAIN, itself, immediately before it spawns, and
    refuses any loopback, private, link-local, CGNAT or unspecified answer
    (D36). The first check ran a MeTube round trip earlier, and a name that
    has started answering 10.0.0.5 since then is the rebinding the first check
    cannot see. yt-dlp resolves a third time and follows redirects, which no
    check here covers (§7 of the design, and guard.py's docstring).
  * It runs in a subprocess with a hard kill, cwd on a directory it cannot
    write, `--no-config` and `--no-cache-dir` so nothing on disk influences it
    and nothing is left behind, and an environment of three fixed variables,
    so nothing this service was started with -- a proxy setting, a path to its
    credential volume -- reaches a process that runs on a user's URL.
  * Its failure mode is a title-only confirm card, never a blocked or broken
    fetch. A stale extractor here costs an estimate, not a download.

If the operator would rather not carry it at all, UI_PROBE=0 removes it and
the card degrades to MeTube's title. The upstream fix is three lines in
MeTube's `to_public_dict` to carry duration and filesize_approx, which is
worth sending and is not worth blocking on.
