"""The Jobs tab as a run log over all three kinds of run.

Static, for the reason test_interface.py and test_playback.py are: what these
assert is a property of the bytes in ui.html -- which query the filter sends,
which fields a row dereferences, what a control says when it has no number --
and starting a browser to find that out would add a dependency to a service
whose whole claim is that it has none.

Every test here is named after a defect that was in the file or after one this
change could introduce. The two that matter most are the two silent ones: a
single record with a realtime factor and no audio_seconds took the WHOLE tab
into "The job list could not be drawn", and a filter applied on this side of
the wire silently hides rows that only exist past the server's fifty-row cap.
