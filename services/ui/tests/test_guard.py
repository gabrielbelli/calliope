"""The SSRF pre-filter, which is the one thing here that must not be wrong.

Every address rule is asserted against an injected resolver rather than against
whatever DNS says today: the point is to prove that a NAME resolving to a
private address is refused, and there is no public name that reliably does
that on someone else's network.
