"""Mock gateway and mock MeTube, wired in through httpx's own transport layer.

NO SERVER IS STARTED BY ANY TEST HERE, and none may be: the app is exercised
as the real ASGI app through fastapi.testclient, and the two things it talks to
are replaced at the httpx transport rather than at a socket. So the forwarding
code, the header filtering, the streaming and the error mapping are the real
ones — only the wire is fake.

That is the same shape services/gateway/tests uses, and it is why httpx was
worth the dependency in both: a hand-rolled fake client would have tested this
service's idea of httpx rather than httpx.

The app is reloaded per test because its configuration is read at import,
exactly as it is in the four siblings and exactly as it is in the container,
where the process is the unit of configuration.
