"""Whether a streamed answer crosses this service as a stream.

The Speak tab asks tts-stack for `stream_format: "sse"` so the first sentence
can be played while the rest is still being made, and every byte of that
crosses this process. A relay that read the upstream body to the end before
answering would deliver exactly the same bytes, the same headers and the same
log line, and the only symptom would be a service that looks slow. There is
nothing in a response to see it in, so it is asserted here.

NOT THROUGH TestClient, and that is why this file exists rather than a few more
tests in test_ui.py. starlette's TestClient writes every response body message
into a BytesIO and hands back the finished bytes, so time to first byte through
it is always time to last byte: a streamed response and a collected one are
indistinguishable, which is how a proxy that quietly buffers passes a suite.
The app is driven as raw ASGI instead, and the `send` callable is the witness.
