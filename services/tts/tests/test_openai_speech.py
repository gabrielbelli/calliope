Every assertion here is a defect that was really found on a running instance,

pulled 340 MB of weights into CI would be switched off within a week, which is
worse than any defect it guards. The chunking and the encoders are real, so
what is faked is the model and nothing else.

    """The property that separates a stream from a buffer sliced up afterwards.

    Nothing else in this file would catch that regression: the deltas of a
    faked stream concatenate to the buffered body just as well as a real one's
    do, and every shape assertion passes either way. So this pulls one frame
    out of the generator and asks the synthesiser how much work it had been
    given by the time that frame existed.

    Driven at the generator rather than over HTTP because starlette's
    TestClient runs the whole ASGI app to completion and hands back a
    BytesIO — it buffers, so it cannot show when anything left. The
    HTTP-level proof is a measurement on the running service instead, on the
    schema's own 4096-character maximum: 12 frames, first byte at 4.32 s of a
    47.66 s stream, against 50.20 s before the buffered response sends
    anything at all. 11.6x sooner, first byte at 9% of total.

    `pcm` because it is the one format with no encoder between the model and
    the wire — a codec's lookahead window is a legitimate reason for a first
    delta to arrive one chunk late, and this test is not about the codec.
