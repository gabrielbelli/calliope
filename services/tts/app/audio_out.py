"""Encoding, incremental. One generator, both stream formats.

    [ndarray, ndarray, …]  ->  encode_stream(chunks, fmt)  ->  b"", b"", …

**Why this is a generator and not a function returning bytes.** `stream_format`
gives one request two possible shapes for the same audio: a buffered body, and
a run of `speech.audio.delta` events whose base64 payloads a client
concatenates. Those two have to agree — a client that streams and a client that
does not must be able to compare files — and the only way to guarantee that is
for both to come out of the same encoder. So the route drains this generator for
a buffered response and frames each yield as a delta for an SSE one, and the two
cannot drift because there is nothing to drift.

**The claim is about the ENCODER, and it holds for the chunks it is given.**
Since the latency ramp, `stream_format: "sse"` asks app.main.ramp_schedule for
small leading chunks on an input of at least RAMP_MIN_PHONEMES, and a chunk
boundary is a thing the duration predictor sees. So a ramped request and its
buffered twin carry the same words spoken slightly differently, not the same
samples, and comparing them byte for byte is not a test of anything. Every
buffered request, and every input below that threshold, is unchanged.

**One sample conversion, `voice_common.audio.pcm_bytes`, feeding every format.**
Before this, `wav` went through libsndfile and `pcm` through pcm_bytes, and the
two rounded differently: measured over one utterance, 54.6% of samples differed,
by up to 2 LSB. Both routes claimed to carry the same samples and did not. The
44-byte header written below is byte-identical to the one libsndfile wrote —
verified against `sf.write` output — so the only change to a `wav` body is that
its samples now match the `pcm` body of the same request exactly.

**mp3, aac, opus and flac go to ffmpeg on a pipe rather than through a temporary
file.** A file has to be complete before it can be read, which is the whole
defect this module exists to remove. Measured feeding a 10 s clip in five
pieces, encoded bytes come back after every piece: mp3 15020 bytes after the
first, aac 15025, flac 22938, opus 135. `-flush_packets 1` changes none of
those numbers, so it is not passed.

Three container-level consequences of encoding to a pipe, all measured against
the same input encoded to a file, all documented in the README:

  * mp3  loses the 192-byte Xing/`Info` frame. It records the total frame count
         and is written by seeking back to the start, which a pipe cannot do.
  * flac STREAMINFO carries zero for total-samples and for the MD5, the
         standard streaming convention for the same reason.
  * aac  is byte-identical either way.
  * opus is byte-identical for a given process, and never reproducible between
         two of them: the Ogg serial number is randomised per stream, so two
         identical buffered requests already returned different bytes today.
  * wav  is the one format whose buffered form is NOT the concatenation of its
         streamed form — see `encode`.
