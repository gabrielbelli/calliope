"""Kokoro speech synthesis.

One model, 82M parameters, 310 MB of shared weights. A voice is a separate
510 KB embedding tensor — so switching voices costs nothing after load, and a
request may use a different voice per segment if it wants. Only swapping the
model itself is expensive, and there is only one model.

**The chunking is this module's, not kokoro-onnx's, and that is a fix rather
than a preference.** Upstream `_split_phonemes` bounds the phoneme STRING and
breaks only on `[.,!?;]`, so a long run between two full stops arrives at
`_create_audio` as one oversized batch, is truncated to exactly 510 phonemes,
tokenises to exactly 510 tokens, and then indexes a voice tensor of shape
(510, 1, 256) at row 510. Measured: 400 characters of unpunctuated English
phonemise to 518 symbols and return HTTP 500, "index 510 is out of bounds for
axis 0 with size 510", from ordinary prose well inside the 4096-character
input the schema allows. `plan()` below bounds every chunk at 509 and splits a
punctuation-free run at a space, so the row index can never reach 510.

Splitting here rather than inside `create()` is also what makes streaming
possible at all: the route gets a list of chunks it can synthesise one at a
time and send as it goes, instead of one call that returns when the last word
is finished.

    The greedy fill is upstream's, deliberately and line for line, because the

    /v1/audio/speech return the samples they always returned. Verified against
    `Kokoro._split_phonemes` on 400 randomly generated English texts of 3 to
    400 words: identical batches on all 400, and the route's audio is
    bit-identical to what `create()` returned for the same text.

    Two things are added, and only two. Batches are bounded at `cap`, which
    upstream's are not: it appends a punctuation mark to a full batch without
    re-checking the length, and it starts a new batch from a run it has already
    decided is too long, so a long stretch between two full stops arrives at
    the model as 510 tokens and indexes a 510-row voice tensor at row 510. And
    an empty batch is dropped, which upstream emits whenever the first piece is
    over the limit — a model call with nothing in it.
