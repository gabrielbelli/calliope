"""Self-hosted text-to-speech. Kokoro, CPU only.

    text or segments -> phonemise -> Kokoro -> wav, opus, mp3, aac, flac, pcm

There is one model and it stays resident: at 330 MB and 4x realtime on CPU it
is too cheap to unload. Chatterbox, the long-form alternative, is deliberately
not here — it needs 5.3 GB and runs below realtime, so it belongs behind a
separate service that can be started on demand.

Two request shapes reach the same synthesiser. `/speak` is the native one and
the one to prefer: it takes segments with explicit pauses and a voice each,
and returns the realtime factor in headers. `/v1/audio/speech` is OpenAI's
shape, kept alongside so existing clients need only a base URL change; it can
express none of those things.

`/v1/audio/speech` answers `stream_format: "sse"` with real server-sent events.
The synthesiser produces a chunk at a time, so a delta leaves as soon as the
first chunk is encoded rather than when the last one is: measured on the
schema's own 4096-character maximum, the first frame goes out after 5.49 s of a
55.06 s generation, against 58.98 s before a buffered response sends anything at
all. That parameter used to be accepted and dropped — a caller that asked for a
stream got a single buffered mp3, HTTP 200, no error, and no way to tell.

THIS SERVICE IS NEVER DISPATCHED TO ANOTHER MACHINE, and the reason is written
here so it is not re-litigated from the dispatcher's side. tts-long chooses
between this box and the GPU on spring because Chatterbox runs at 0.23x
realtime here and one job takes twenty minutes. Kokoro runs at 2.79x on orko at
8 threads — buffered, faster than the speech it produces, with somebody
watching the page — so any dispatch decision could only ADD a round trip to a
request that is already quick, and there is no Kokoro on spring to add it to.
What DOES leave this container is the finished run's record; see `runlog`.

    must be able to tell those apart, so this one reports nothing at all until
    something has actually been synthesised, and `value` stays None until then.

    since the last delta arrived, which is the honest reading of "the next
    delta is already late". So a chunk may be as large as its generation fits

    that would have finished in 29 s — blocked on a pipe read, holding its
    memory, waiting for a stdin that will never close.

    Starlette stops iterating the generator on disconnect, correctly. What it
    does not do is close it, so `encode_stream`'s `except GeneratorExit` — the
    branch that kills the encoder — runs only when the suspended generator is
    finally collected. Proved with an instrumented generator under uvicorn:
    after the client closed the socket, iteration stopped immediately, and
    `GeneratorExit` did not arrive until a `gc.collect()` was forced by hand.
    It is a reference cycle, so refcounting never frees it, and on a service
    that is not allocating hard the cyclic collector may not run for minutes.

    Closing it here makes that deterministic and owes nothing to the garbage
    collector: whichever way the response ended — finished, disconnected, or
    raised — `close()` throws GeneratorExit in at the yield, and the encoder
    is killed before this coroutine returns.

    Safe to call at this point, and only at this point: starlette awaits each
    chunk before sending it, and anyio waits for an in-flight worker thread
    before propagating a cancellation, so by the time `__call__` returns the
