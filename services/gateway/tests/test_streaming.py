"""Whether a streamed answer crosses the gateway as a stream.

tts-stack answers `stream_format: "sse"` with one event per chunk of audio, so
a caller can play the first sentence while the rest is still being made, and
every byte of that crosses this process. A proxy that read the upstream body to
the end before answering would deliver identical bytes, identical headers and
an identical log line: the only symptom is a stack that looks slow, and there
is nothing in a response to see it in.

NOT THROUGH httpx.ASGITransport, which is what the rest of this suite uses.
That transport collects the response body before it returns, so time to first
byte through it is always time to last byte and a proxy that buffers is
indistinguishable from one that does not. The app is driven as raw ASGI here
and the `send` callable is the witness.
