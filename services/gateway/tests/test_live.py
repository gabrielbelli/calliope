"""The gateway against the three real services of a deployment, or nothing at all.

The mocked suite proves the routing rules. It cannot prove the two things that
only a real backend can disagree about: that these paths exist on the far side
with these shapes, and that streaming a real multipart upload and a real audio
response through httpx produces the bytes the client asked for.

So this runs the actual app in-process with its backend URLs pointed at the
live containers, over real sockets. It is SKIPPED, not failed, when no host
is named or it is unreachable — the usual case on a CI runner, on a train, or when the NAS is
asleep — because a test suite that fails when someone's house is offline stops
being read.

Nothing here queues a Chatterbox job. tts-long runs one job at a time on a
6.5 GB model that takes minutes to load, and a test suite that enqueued work on
a shared machine would be a test suite people learn to avoid running. The long
path is exercised read-only, through GET /jobs.

    GATEWAY_LIVE_HOST=nas.example.com   the host the three run on (unset: skipped)
    GATEWAY_LIVE=0                            skip even when it is reachable
