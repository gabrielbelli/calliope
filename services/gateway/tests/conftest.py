"""Mock backends, wired in through httpx's own transport layer.

The gateway is exercised as the real ASGI app, through a real httpx client, so
every test below runs the actual proxy code — header filtering, streaming,
timeout mapping and all. Only the socket is replaced: `Router` dispatches by
hostname to a mock backend, and a mock backend is a plain ASGI callable that
records what reached it.

That is why httpx was worth the dependency. A hand-rolled fake client would
have tested the gateway's idea of httpx rather than httpx.

The app is reloaded per test because its configuration — backend URLs,
timeouts, GATEWAY_API_KEYS — is read at import, exactly as it is in the
siblings and exactly as it is in the container, where the process is the unit
of configuration.
