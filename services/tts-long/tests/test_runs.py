"""The record store: what survives its audio, and what a sender may say.

THE INVERSION THIS FILE IS ABOUT. `_recover` used to walk the AUDIO files and
read a note beside each one, so a record with no file was an orphan and was
deleted. Instant speech and transcriptions keep no audio at all, and a clone
job whose audio was swept is a row people still want, so records with no file
are now the majority. The record is the index; the audio is an attachment.

Every test is named after the mistake it prevents.

    they assert that a record CONTAINING `voice` recovers it -- and they stay
    green if `voice` is dropped from `RECORD_KEYS`, because the file they wrote
    never went through `_write_record`. The old shape had no record at all: the
    walk was over audio files, what the filename carries is the id and the

    chose to write down. It is the only shape that witnesses both halves --
    that `voice` is written, and that it is read back.

    in the filename. The record is the index, it costs a few hundred bytes, and
