"""Three lines that carry loud comments and had no test behind them.

An audit mutated each of these and every suite in the repository stayed green,
which means the comment above the line was the only thing defending it.

  * `_estimate` divides by whatever the CHOSEN lane achieves. Reverting it to
    the local rate -- which is what it did before lanes, and what makes the
    number look reasonable -- promises twenty-one minutes for a job that takes
    seven, and the caller who was told twenty-one minutes goes away.
    `test_dispatch.py` pins `Dispatcher.estimate_for`; nothing asked what a
    CALLER is actually told, which is the only number that leaves the process.
  * `segments_from_runner` and `fell_back_from` are both ACCUMULATED and both
    say so in capitals. Assignment passes every existing test, because no test
    ever hands the same job back twice.

NOTHING HERE OPENS A SOCKET OR LOADS A MODEL.
