"""The voice registry, and the one thing about it that changed.

app/voices.py imports nothing but os and pathlib, so this file runs without
torch, without chatterbox and without the 6.5 GB of weights the rest of the
service needs — which is the point: the behaviour under test is a directory
listing and a stat(), and it should be assertable in milliseconds.
