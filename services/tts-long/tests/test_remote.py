# The runner sold its card and its processor as two service ids over one host,
# and the chooser had a whole arithmetic for the second: read the published
# cap, derate the measured rate by it, compare against the local backlog. Eight
# tests covered it and all eight passed. NOT ONE OF THEM COULD HAVE FAILED IN
# PRODUCTION, because the rung had never run a single job and could not:
#
#   * the server sets TTS_RUNNER_CPU_SERVICE=chatterbox-cpu and the runner
#     registers exactly two services, `echo` and `chatterbox`. Every offer was
#     `no_such_service`;
#   * and the rung sat BELOW `local` in the shipped order, while `local` is a
#     rung that is always willing -- so nothing below it was ever asked.
#
# The arithmetic refuses it anyway at the measured rates: 300 s of speech is
# 1250 s on the runner's processor against 1304 s here, and 1250 x 1.25 is more
# than 1304. It is not a special case any more; it is a lane that would lose.
# The two-lane chooser is asserted in tests/test_dispatch.py instead.
