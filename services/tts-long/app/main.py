"""Long-form text-to-speech. Chatterbox on CPU, as a job queue.

Kokoro (tts-stack) answers requests. This does not: at roughly 0.21x realtime
a ten-minute recording takes three quarters of an hour, so an HTTP request
that waits for the audio would time out long before it arrived.

So /jobs accepts work and returns immediately with an id. ONE JOB AT A TIME
PER MACHINE, and the reason is not the one this docstring used to give. It said
the model is 6.5 GB and concurrency would double the memory; the real
constraint is that Synth._speak holds one threading.Lock across _ensure_loaded
and generate(), so two local jobs do not run side by side at all — they
interleave at segment granularity, for no extra throughput and double the
latency of each. A second machine is therefore the only thing that can make two
jobs overlap, and app/dispatch.py is how: one lane here, one lane on the
runner, chosen per job rather than walked as a ladder.

/v1/audio/speech sits on top of the same queue for OpenAI clients, and it now
answers in all three of the ways that endpoint can honestly be answered here:

  * `stream_format: "sse"` streams the audio as it is generated. This is the
    route worth using for anything long. The first `speech.audio.delta` leaves
    when the FIRST SENTENCE finishes rather than when the whole input does, so
    a caller hears sound in tens of seconds instead of waiting out a silence
    measured in minutes. It does not make the service faster — the compute is
    unchanged — it removes the dead air and the client-side timeout.
  * input short enough that the arithmetic allows it is waited on and returned
    as one buffered body, which is what an unmodified OpenAI client needs.
  * anything longer gets 202 and a Location header pointing at the native job.
    That is a deliberate deviation from OpenAI's contract, documented in the
    README with the measurement that forces it.

Every input is split into sentence-sized chunks before it reaches the model,
and that is a bug fix rather than a streaming detail: generate() stops after
1000 speech tokens, which is 40 seconds of audio, and 1690 characters measured
on the deployed instance came back as exactly 40.0 seconds with no error. See
app/chunking.py.

The native routes stay the ones to prefer for batch work — realtime_factor,
per-segment pauses and the queue position have no field in the OpenAI shape
and are dropped there.

Authentication, the health contract, the error envelope, `Segment` and the
logging setup are voice_common's. app/envelope.py is gone: it was this
service's private copy of the envelope, written while voice-common was pinned
by tarball SHA, and every line of it now lives in voice_common.errors — it was
the best of the three vendored copies and the one the shared code was built
from, so this service's wire output did not change. app/encoders.py is the one
encoder both the buffered and the streamed paths use. What is left in this file
is the queue, which is the whole reason this service exists separately from
tts-stack.

    install_health registers `/health` AND exempts exactly that string from
    authentication, so a rename can no longer lock the container healthcheck
    out — the two used to be independent literals in two modules.

    It also makes the route `async def`, which this service had already paid to
    learn: a sync route runs on AnyIO's forty-thread pool, shared with
    /v1/audio/speech, which held a thread for up to TTS_OPENAI_SYNC_TIMEOUT
    seconds each. Forty concurrent speech requests starved the pool, /health
    stopped answering, and an orchestrator restarted a service that was merely
    busy.

    WHICH IS WHY THE RUNNER IS ASKED OFF THE LOOP. `install_health` says it in
    capitals -- details must not block, it runs on the event loop -- and the
    runner panel broke it: `RunnerClient.snapshot()` is a cache-missing
    BLOCKING call over the LAN to a desktop that is allowed to be switched off.
    Measured: /health took 3.0 s and GET /jobs took 2.7 s WHILE IT WAITED. It
    was never one slow route. Nothing else ran at all -- not the listing, not
    /v1/audio/speech, not the SSE routes -- so a machine that drops packets
    rather than refusing them stopped a service that could speak perfectly
    well. `snapshot()` is on the three-second offer clock now as well, because
    moving a thirty-second wait off the loop still leaves it holding a
    healthcheck open past its own timeout.
