"""Where a job runs, and why this is lanes rather than a queue and a ladder.

WHAT THIS REPLACES AND THE FAILURE IT PREVENTS. One `queue.Queue` fed one
worker thread, and that thread walked a LADDER: it asked the runner whether it
was free, waited for the answer, and only then started work. Two things
followed and both were measured.

  * A RUNNER THAT ANSWERS SLOWLY DELAYED A LOCAL JOB. `RunnerConfig.timeout`
    is thirty seconds, `offer()` was called on the worker's own thread, once
    per job per rung, and it was deliberately not cached. A runner that accepts
    a TCP connection and then says nothing therefore added thirty seconds of
    silence to a job that was always going to run here. With the machine
    switched off it is a refused connection and it is fast; with the machine
    ASLEEP, or wedged, or behind a firewall that drops rather than rejects, it
    is the full timeout. That is INVARIANT L below, and it is a test.
  * THE SECOND JOB WAITED FOR THE FIRST EVEN WHEN THE FIRST HAD LEFT THE
    BUILDING. One worker means one job at a time, so a ten-minute job handed to
    the runner's card held this host's completely idle CPU hostage for the
    whole ten minutes. Measured: 300 seconds of speech is 1304 s here and 437 s
    there, so the second job started twenty-one minutes late for no reason at
    all.

THE SHAPE. `pending` is a deque under one Condition. ONE chooser thread is the
only thing that reads a lane's readiness and the only thing that hands a job to
a lane; each lane has ONE runner thread that does nothing but execute what it
is given. The chooser NEVER makes a network call -- `LaneProbe` does that on
its own thread, and the chooser reads the tuple it left behind. Ten seconds of
staleness costs at most one wrong lane choice, which the yield path already
recovers; a network call on the job's thread costs the job.

WIDTH IS ONE ON BOTH LANES AND LOCAL'S IS NOT CONFIGURABLE. `Synth._speak`
holds one `threading.Lock` across `_ensure_loaded()` and `generate()`, so two
local jobs do not overlap -- they interleave at segment granularity for zero
extra throughput and double the latency of each. Every concurrency this module
delivers comes from the SECOND MACHINE, not from a second thread here.

`runner_cpu` IS NOT A LANE, AND THE SERVER NO LONGER CONFIGURES ONE EITHER. The
agent on that desktop registers only `echo` and `chatterbox`, so the rung was
never offered a job and never can be; at its measured 0.24x against this host's
0.23x the arithmetic below would refuse it anyway. A lane nothing can reach is
a lane nothing tests. The knobs that named it -- TTS_RUNNER_CPU_SERVICE,
TTS_RUNNER_CPU_MAX_WAIT, TTS_REALTIME_FACTOR_RUNNER_CPU -- went on being parsed
for two releases after the rung died, which is the same falsehood one level
down; app/remote.py's `RunnerConfig` says where they went.
