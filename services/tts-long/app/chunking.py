"""Split text into pieces one generate() call can actually finish.

This exists for two reasons, and the first one is a bug rather than a feature.

**Chatterbox truncates.** `ChatterboxMultilingualTTS.generate` calls
`t3.inference(..., max_new_tokens=1000)` (chatterbox-tts 0.1.7,
chatterbox/mtl_tts.py:297) and S3 speech tokens run at 25 Hz
(chatterbox/models/s3tokenizer/s3tokenizer.py:18, `S3_TOKEN_RATE = 25`), so a
single call cannot emit more than **40 seconds** of audio no matter how much
text it is handed. Measured on the deployed instance on 2026-09-01: 1690
characters of ordinary prose, which is around 170 seconds of speech, came back
as `audio_seconds: 40.0` after 184.6 s of compute. No error, no warning — the
caller got the first quarter of their text read out and a wav file that ends
mid-sentence. Everything past that point was paid for in CPU and thrown away.

Splitting the input and splicing the pieces is the fix, and it is the only
fix: the ceiling is inside the model's inference loop.

**And it is what makes streaming possible.** generate() is autoregressive over
the whole string it is given and returns nothing until it finishes, so the
first byte of a stream cannot precede the first COMPLETED piece. Chunk size is
therefore the floor on time-to-first-audio, which is why the target below is a
sentence rather than the largest thing that fits.

**The same text, chunked, on the same instance.** 1690 characters submitted as
one string produced 40.0 s of audio in 184.6 s. Submitted as twenty segments it
produced **100.2 s of audio** in 338.1 s — two and a half times as much speech
from the same words, because none of it was thrown away.

Measured speech rate, all four samples:

    65 chars   ->   6.6 s    9.8 chars/s   one short sentence
    336 chars  ->  17.4 s   19.3 chars/s   one passage
    1690 chars -> 100.2 s   16.9 chars/s   twenty segments
    1690 chars ->  40.0 s          n/a     truncated, so it measures nothing

The spread is real: a short utterance carries a fixed half-second or so of
silence at each end, which dominates it. CHARS_PER_SECOND below is the middle
of that range and it is only ever used for estimates and for sizing chunks, so
being wrong in either direction costs an inaccurate `estimated_seconds` rather
than audio. The chunk ceiling is checked against the SLOWEST of the four.
