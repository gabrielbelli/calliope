"""Speak on somebody else's GPU, over TLS, and fall back the moment it is gone.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Chatterbox is the only component in this stack slower than
realtime: 0.275x on the NAS's CPU at eight threads, which is about four minutes
of compute per minute of audio. Parakeet does 8.81x and Kokoro 1.83x on the same
CPU and neither wants a GPU. So there is exactly one reason to reach across a
network, and this module is it.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a client for a cluster, a broker or a scheduler.
There is no central server, and the runner on the other end is an `offpeak`
agent listening on its own machine with a pinned self-signed certificate. If
several runners ever exist, a chooser goes in front of this and nothing here
changes.

THE SHAPE, AND THE ONE RULE IT KEEPS

`RemoteSynth` implements exactly the signature `Synth.speak_segments` has, and
nothing else, so `_run()` never learns which one it got:

    speak_segments(segments, language, controls, reference,
                   on_chunk=..., cancelled=...) -> Spoken

`controls` is one mapping of {field: value} rather than one parameter per
field, and the change is what makes a fourth engine no signature edit at all:
which keys exist is read off the engine's own catalogue row, and an engine with
no such control contributes no key. Three floats spelled out here, in
Synth.speak_segments, in `_run`'s positional call and in `_vendor_fields` were
four places to widen for a fourth field -- and `_run` calls this positionally
on whichever backend it was handed, so two signatures that drift apart are a
defect nothing catches until a job runs on the lane nobody tested.

Everything after that call stays here on this host and is untouched: the
encoding, the chunk boundaries, the file write into OUT_DIR named by the local
job id, the sidecar. Those are pinned by byte-exact tests against *this*
machine's ffmpeg, and moving them to a stranger's Windows box would turn them
into facts about a build nobody in this repository controls.

WHAT CROSSES THE WIRE

Per segment, in order: raw float32 PCM at 24000 Hz, plus that segment's input
token count. Not encoded audio, and not one blob at the end. One blob would kill
streaming and would kill `offsets`, which is an exact boundary recorded in the
sidecar and is built from the per-segment callback.

The reference clip crosses as BYTES, content-addressed. `job["reference"]` is an
absolute path inside a volume on the NAS; a machine on somebody's desk has no
such directory and never will. So the clip is hashed, `HEAD /v1/assets/<sha256>`
asks whether the runner already holds it, and the bytes are sent only on a miss.
The digest is the identity and the name is a label, which is also what keeps a
cloned voice's NAME out of anything that crosses a network.

A YIELD IS NOT A FAILURE, AND THIS IS THE PART MOST LIKELY TO BE GOT WRONG

The runner gives the GPU back the instant its owner touches the machine. Under
six seconds for a known game. That is the NORMAL case, several times an evening,
and it is not an error at any level: the job is WAITED OUT here, inside
`speak_segments`, and reported as `queued` on the local job while it waits.

Waiting rather than restarting is what makes "a job is never spoken twice" a
property rather than a hope, and it closes three separate routes to it at once.
The lease on the runner survives under the same idempotency key, so segments it
already produced are not produced again. The `seen` set means segments already
collected are not collected again. And because the call never returns, `_run` is
never re-entered, so no encoder is rebuilt and no SSE client receives a second
file header half way through a stream.

`RemoteYield` is therefore raised for one thing only: the bounded wait running
out, which means the owner has been at the machine long enough that the local
CPU would have finished. It says "speak this here instead", not "this failed".

        and "ready" for the service, and separately whether the machine is free,
        and the reason those are separate fields is exactly this function.
        `not_installed` is the owner's to fix and will not change on its own;
        `machine_busy` is nobody's to fix and clears in a minute or two. A caller
        that cannot tell them apart either retries for ever against a runner with
        no speech service, or gives up on one that was about to be free.

        WHY THE PER-SERVICE `available` FIELD IS PREFERRED. The runner sells its
        processor as well as its card now, and one boolean cannot answer "will
        you work for me" any more. A game takes the GPU and leaves twelve threads
        idle; a compile takes every thread and leaves the card at five per cent.
        Reading the machine-wide `gpu_available` would walk away from a runner
        that was about to speak on the CPU, and working it out here from a device
        name and two booleans would be this side reimplementing a decision the
        runner already makes correctly, including the memory headroom check we
        cannot see from here.

        `gpu_available` IS STILL READ, as the fallback, because a runner that
        predates the split does not publish `available` at all and answering
        "busy" for ever against a perfectly good older runner is a worse failure
        than being slightly conservative.

        where one job goes and is asked once per job; that one is drawn on a
