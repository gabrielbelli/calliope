"""Where each locale's audio comes from.

Several sources per locale on purpose. A single corpus measures one recording
condition and one speaking style, and a model can be excellent on read speech
while falling apart on spontaneous speech at the same WER budget. Reading one
number off one dataset hides exactly the differences worth knowing about.

Sources are tagged by STYLE (read / spontaneous / crowd) and are not
comparable across tags. Compare a source against its own history across runs.
