"""Named glossary profiles, asserted against the failures that motivated them.

Every test here is named after the thing that goes wrong without it, because
two of these failures are silent by construction: a profile that ships one
person's project names into a public image is invisible to the person it is
applied to, and a PUT that half-succeeded leaves a file that looks fine.

Nothing in this module loads a model. The pipeline's state is filled in by
hand, exactly as test_parity does it, so the suite runs in CI where the real
