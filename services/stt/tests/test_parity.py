"""The OpenAI surface, asserted against a recogniser that is not a model.

Every assertion here is a gap that was really found on this service by driving
it with openai-python 3.6.0, and the point of the fake engine is that CI can
run all of them: the real ones are 460 MB and 2.9 GB, and a parity suite that
only runs where a model is already downloaded is a parity suite that stops
running.

The fake is deliberately a *capability profile* rather than a mock of one
engine. What the route does with a field is decided by the flags in asr.py, so
the two profiles here are the two deployments: one that can translate, stream
and take a language hint, and one that can do none of those and reports
per-token logprobs instead. That is Whisper and Parakeet as far as this module
is concerned, and a third engine would only have to declare its flags.
