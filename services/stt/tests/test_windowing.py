"""Long audio, asserted against a recogniser that is not a model.

THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. A 13m38s recording came back

    Transcription failed: stt-stack could not be reached: RemoteProtocolError

and the 500 underneath it was

    [ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : FAIL : Non-zero status code returned while
    running Add node. Name:'/layers.0/self_attn/Add_2'

Parakeet's Conformer encoder attends over everything it is handed in one pass,
O(n^2) in the length, and pipeline.run handed it the whole VAD-filtered
waveform. Bisected against the deployed service: 6.6 min answered 200 in
71.2 s, 7.7 min answered 500 in 7.6 s. Not a timeout, not a body-size limit --
the failure arrives faster than the successes because the encoder gives up
inside the first layer.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY HARD HERE IS THE OFFSETS, NOT THE SPLIT. A shift bug is
invisible in the first window and wrong in every window after it, so a test
that checks a transcript from the top of a clip proves nothing. Every assertion
below that touches a timestamp reads the END of the audio.

The fake engine reports one word per second of whatever it is handed, timed in
that pass's own compacted timeline, which is what a real recogniser does: it
has no idea a window is a window. So the arithmetic under test is entirely this
service's.
