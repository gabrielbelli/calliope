"""Self-hosted speech-to-text. One container, one model.

    audio -> VAD -> recogniser -> glossary repair -> text

Parakeet by default, Whisper by request. There is no LLM cleanup stage and no
second recogniser; both were tried and measured, and both made the transcript
worse. The reasoning is in asr.py and in the README.

Three routes reach the same pipeline. /transcribe is native and returns
everything the run measured; /v1/audio/transcriptions and
/v1/audio/translations are OpenAI-compatible and return the subset that
specification has fields for, so existing clients work unchanged. Prefer the
native one where you control the client — see openai_api.py for what the
compatible shape has to drop, and for the one rule that surface is built
around: every field is honoured or refused by name, never accepted and
dropped.

The wire contract around those routes — the API keys, the 401, OpenAI's error
envelope, the health route and the log configuration — comes from voice_common,
which this service shares with tts-stack and tts-long. Three hand-vendored
copies of that code had drifted into three different defects; the package
docstrings carry the detail. app/errors.py is gone with them: it completed the
envelope with `param` and the 404/405 handlers while voice-common was pinned by
tarball SHA and could not be changed from here, and all of it now lives in
voice_common.errors. Everything below this line is what is genuinely particular
to speech-to-text.

# NATIVE ROUTES, NOT /v1, and the reason is ADR 0001 rather than convenience:
# OpenAI has no concept of a glossary profile, so there is nothing here to be
# 1:1 with. Claiming /v1/glossaries would be taking specification territory
# that does not exist, and would collide the day OpenAI uses that path. Native
# routes are explicitly out of that ADR's scope, so these keep FastAPI's
# {"detail": ...} bodies like /transcribe does.
#
# AUTHENTICATION IS STT_API_KEYS, unchanged, and it is worth saying plainly
# what that means rather than leaving it in a comment nobody reads: with the
# keys unset — which is how this stack is deployed today — a write API is an
# UNAUTHENTICATED write API. Set them before mounting the volume. The README
# says so where an operator will actually meet it.
#
# Writability follows the volume. This is not a permission system and calling
# it one would be dishonest: a deployment that mounted nowhere to persist has
# said, by omission, that it does not want run-time profiles, and accepting a
# PUT that evaporates on the next restart would be worse than refusing it. Same
# reasoning as the UI's clips.writable().
