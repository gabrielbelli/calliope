"""The transcription pipeline, separate from the shape it is returned in.

    audio -> VAD -> windows -> recogniser -> glossary repair -> text

Three routes share this: the native /transcribe, which returns everything the
run measured, and /v1/audio/transcriptions and /v1/audio/translations, which
return the subset OpenAI's specification has fields for. The work lives here so
the compatibility layer cannot slowly become a second pipeline that drifts from
the first — which is the usual way these shims rot.

Three things this file owns that the recogniser cannot:

  the windows    Parakeet's encoder attends over everything it is handed at
                 once, O(n^2) in the length, and past about seven minutes of
                 speech it does not slow down, it returns an ONNX Runtime
                 failure out of the first layer's self-attention. So the speech
                 is cut into passes at the VAD's pauses and the results are
                 stitched. MAX_WINDOW_SECONDS carries the measurement;
                 _windows carries the offsets argument.

  the timeline   The ASR sees speech runs, concatenated. Every timestamp it
                 reports is in that compacted timeline, and a subtitle needs
                 them in the client's. vad.Speech carries the offsets; the
                 mapping is applied here, once, for both engines.

  the segments   Whisper reports its own. Parakeet reports words only, so its
                 segments are cut at the VAD's boundaries — real pauses in the
                 recording, which is the only honest place to cut. Two of the
                 ten required fields have no Parakeet equivalent and are
                 synthesised; see _segments_from_words.

# 300 s is a MEASURED success on the deployed host, not an interpolation
