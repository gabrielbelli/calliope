"""Post-transcription term repair: the mechanism, not the vocabulary.

The repair happens after decoding, on the text. It is one of the two halves a
glossary has here, and it is the half that runs unconditionally on both
engines.

WHAT THIS HEADER USED TO SAY, AND WHY THE CORRECTION MATTERS. It said Parakeet
"takes no `hotwords` and no `initial_prompt`, so nothing here can steer the
decoder", and offered this module as the consolation prize. The first clause is
true and the conclusion was wrong: onnx-asr's greedy TDT loop is plain Python
with the joint's logits in hand, and boosting.py steers that decoder directly.
The sentence read as a statement about the model when it was a statement about
an argument list, and it is why this service refused `prompt` with a 400 for
months.

So repair is no longer the only thing available — but it is still the cheaper
and safer of the two, and the division of labour is worth stating exactly:

  repair    fixes a word the model HEARD and spelled wrong. Costs nothing, has
            no acoustic risk, and cannot be undone by the decoder.
  boosting  can recover a word the model never approached, which repair cannot.
            It is opt-in per request because it is a bet: a boost list whose
            terms are absent from the audio raised WER by 28% on Whisper and nothing measurable on Parakeet
            across 25 cells, and the damage lands inside the decode where
            this module cannot reach it.

TWO KINDS OF RULE, FROM TWO KINDS OF LINE
-----------------------------------------
A glossary profile writes `heard = intended` for a replacement and a bare term
for a hotword, and only the first has ever compiled to a rule here. A bare term
has no `heard` side, so there is nothing to rewrite FROM — which is why a
profile's hotword-only section does nothing on an engine that takes no
vocabulary, and why dictation.txt says so in its own header.

A request's `prompt` and `keywords[]` are bare terms with no other expression
available: a caller cannot write `heard = intended` in a `prompt`, and refusing
the field left the engine this service actually deploys with no way to honour
it at all. `term_rules` is what a bare term CAN do to a finished transcript —
repair its own spelling — and it is deliberately the weaker half. See its
docstring for what it recovers and what it cannot.

WHAT USED TO BE HERE AND IS NOT ANY MORE
----------------------------------------
A module-level `DEFAULT_GLOSSARY` dict, applied to every transcript whether or
not a glossary file existed, holding `ghost paper = Ghost Pepper`,
`theory dashboard = Theoria dashboard`, `clode = Claude Code` and `ghosty =
Ghostty`. It was the same defect as the shipped glossary.txt — one person's
vocabulary inside a public image — with the extra property that no operator
could turn it off, because it was not in a file to delete. Its general entries
now live in the built-in `dictation` profile and are applied only when a
request asks for them; its project names moved to a deployment-supplied
profile (examples/glossaries/personal.txt).

Which terms exist, where they come from and how they are selected is
profiles.py's job. This file only knows how to compile a mapping and apply it.

    """Case repair for BARE terms — the only rewrite a hotword can express.

    A bare term spells its own intended form and names no wrong one, so the
    only rule derivable from it is over its own letters: wherever the
    transcript already contains the term, spell it the way the term was
    written. That recovers the failure the default engine really has on a
    proper noun it DID hear — Parakeet returns "ghost pepper" and "theoria" in
    lower case, every phoneme right and only the capitalisation wrong.

    It cannot recover a word the acoustic model never approached. "Antropic"
    stays "Antropic", because no rule here names "Antropic". That is the same
    limit the module header states, and the route's own comments say it rather
    than implying a prompt does on Parakeet what it does on Whisper.

    Two shapes are skipped, and both skips are the rule rather than tidying:

      * a term that is already entirely lower case. Its rule is either a no-op
        (`kubectl` -> `kubectl`) or actively harmful: `\\bsync\\b -> "sync"`
        LOWERCASES a correct sentence-initial "Sync". The shipped profiles are
        full of these — `commit`, `nginx`, `kubectl` — which is what makes the
        skip worth naming rather than assuming.
      * a term with NO LOWER-CASE LETTER IN IT. This is the mirror of the
        skip above and it was missing, which shipped a defect: `ARM` passed
        both filters and compiled `\\barm\\b -> "ARM"`, so an ordinary
        sentence came back "I SET the ARM on the BUS ... ALL of the tags are
        NEW". Measured over 100 real clips, a plain infrastructure acronym
        list corrupted NINE of them, and the sharpest case was in the locale
        this deployment exists for: `NAS` rewrote the Portuguese preposition
        "nas" in "do primeiro-ministro nas novas notas".

        A case repair is only well defined when the term shows WHICH letters
        are capitals against which are not -- "Theoria", "TrueNAS",
        "Ghost Pepper". An all-capitals term shows no such contrast, so its
        rule is `\\bx\\b -> "X"` over every occurrence of the letters in any
        language, and a three-letter acronym is a word somewhere. There is no
        way to tell the Portuguese "nas" from a misheard "NAS" without a
        dictionary this image does not have -- the same wall the single-word
        check in profiles.py hit.

        The cost is real and worth naming: `ZFS`, `API` and `CPU` no longer
        get case repair. Decoder boosting still takes them, which is the
        mechanism that can actually tell whether the acronym was SAID.
      * a term shorter than MIN_TERM_CHARS.

    A term in a script with no case — `日本語` — is skipped by the first of
    those, and correctly: there is no capitalisation to repair, so its rule
    would rewrite the term to itself. What such a term needs is decoder
    biasing, which this engine does not have and this function does not
    pretend to be.

    Skipping is silent because a term that produced no rule still reached the
    decoder on Whisper and is still not a field that was accepted and dropped:
    what a term did is reported by X-Glossary-Repaired, which names the terms
    that actually rewrote something.
