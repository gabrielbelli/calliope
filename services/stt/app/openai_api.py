"""OpenAI-compatible transcription and translation, alongside the native route.

Anything that already speaks to OpenAI's /v1/audio/transcriptions — the
openai-python client, Open WebUI, a dictation app with a base-URL field —
works against this service unchanged. That is the whole reason this module
exists.

What such a client cannot see is everything /transcribe returns and this
specification has no field for: `realtime_factor` and the `raw` transcript
before glossary repair. The third one, `repaired`, used to be on that list and
is not any more: it is on every buffered response here as the
`x-glossary-repaired` header, because a silent substitution is worse than no
substitution and this surface had no way to say which terms were rewritten.
Prefer /transcribe wherever you control the client.

THE RULE THIS MODULE IS BUILT AROUND
------------------------------------
Every field in the specification is either honoured or refused by name. None is
accepted and dropped. That is not a style preference: a dropped field is a
client that believes something false about the transcript it just received, and
this surface used to drop eleven of them.

  timestamp_granularities[]  now honoured — words and segments both
  chunking_strategy          now honoured — it tunes the VAD this service
                             already runs, which was the sharpest of the drops:
                             the client's settings looked like they had landed
                             on a service that visibly does VAD, and had not
  include[]=logprobs         honoured on the engine that reports per-token
                             logprobs, refused by name on the one that does not
  stream                     honoured on the engine that can genuinely emit
                             before it finishes, refused by name on the one
                             that cannot — see the streaming note below
  language, temperature      honoured on Whisper, refused by name on Parakeet,
                             which has no mechanism for either
  prompt, keywords[]         honoured on BOTH engines and now in BOTH halves:
                             joined into Whisper's hotwords, compiled into this
                             request's post-decode repair, and — when the
                             request set boost=true — fused into Parakeet's TDT
                             decoding loop. Parakeet used to answer them with a
                             400 on the grounds that its decoder took no
                             vocabulary; see _terms and boosting.py for why
                             that was wrong twice over
  glossary                   an EXTENSION, allowlisted beside keywords[] and
                             languages[]: named glossary profiles, applied to
                             this request only. Honoured on both engines, in
                             both halves
  boost                      an EXTENSION on the same pattern, defaulting to
                             OFF: switches on decode-time biasing for this
                             request under Parakeet. Refused by name on Whisper,
                             which biases unconditionally and has no switch.
                             Off by default because irrelevant vocabulary is a
                             measured accuracy cost — see _boost
  languages[], diarisation   refused by name; nothing here can do them
  unknown fields             refused by name. CreateTranscriptionRequest sets
                             additionalProperties: false, and lenience here is
                             the mechanism by which every field above was
                             silently swallowed rather than surfaced

`model` is the one exception, and it is a deliberate one. It is required, as
the specification requires it, and its value cannot choose an engine: Parakeet
needs 1.4 GB resident and Whisper large-v3 2.9 GB, and holding both does not
fit the memory this is deployed under. Refusing `whisper-1` on a Parakeet
deployment would reject every existing client — Open WebUI sends it, this
repository's own README sends it — to make a point about a name. So the request
is answered, and every response on this surface carries `x-stt-engine` naming
the engine that actually ran. Honesty rather than obedience; /health says the
same thing.

GLOSSARY PROFILES
-----------------
Two ways to reach a vocabulary, and the split is ADR 0001's rule about
extensions rather than a preference:

  prompt      the SPECIFICATION'S OWN FIELD, defined as text that guides the
              model, which is exactly what one-off terms are. It needs no
              extension and is what a one-off should use. Read as a list of
              terms, split on commas and newlines; `keywords[]` is the same
              list already shaped as one.
  glossary    the extension, `glossary=tech,dictation` via extra_body. Named
              profiles that live on the server, managed over /glossaries.

A request may send both, and they compose rather than displacing one another:
the profiles' terms first, the request's own last, in both halves. That
ordering is the one rule — a caller's one-off term is never dropped in favour
of a server-side profile.

Absent both, behaviour is the specification's: no glossary, no biasing. A
request naming a profile that does not exist is a 400 NAMING IT — silently
ignoring it would leave a caller believing their vocabulary was applied when it
was not, which is the exact silence this module exists to remove.

Selecting several profiles at once is discouraged, and for a measured reason
rather than a tidy one: a glossary whose terms do NOT occur in the audio raised
WER by 28% on Whisper, and nothing measurable on Parakeet across 25 cells. Irrelevant
terms are not inert.

STREAMING
---------
faster-whisper yields each segment as CTranslate2 finishes the 30-second window
it belongs to, so a stream of deltas is genuinely incremental there. Measured
with tiny/int8 on four threads: a 297 s clip's first delta left 7.8 s into a
68.6 s transcription — 11% of the way — and the same clip's transcription is
one buffered body otherwise. A 14.2 s clip is inside a single window, so its
first and last deltas arrive together at 2.6 s; that is the model's granularity
showing through, not a shortcut here.

Parakeet encodes the whole waveform and then runs a decode loop that emits
nothing until it ends: 5.07 s to the first and only output on that same 14.2 s
clip. There is no partial transcript to send, so `stream=true` is refused by
name under it. Chunking a finished transcript into timed fake deltas would be a
lie a client builds timing assumptions on, and the specification itself notes
that streaming is ignored for whisper-1, so a refusal has precedent.

    THIS FIELD USED TO BE A 400 ON THE DEFAULT ENGINE, and that was the wrong
    reading of both the specification and this module's own rule. `prompt` is
    defined as text that guides the model; vocabulary is what it is used for;
    ADR 0001 says in as many words that feeding a request's glossary terms
    through `prompt` is MORE compliant than refusing it. The refusal was
    justified by the decoder — "Parakeet's TDT decoder takes no vocabulary
    argument and onnx-asr exposes none" — and that justification has since
    turned out to be wrong on its own terms as well as beside the point. It was
    beside the point because the decoder is only one of the two halves a
    glossary has here and the other runs on both engines. It was wrong because
    the missing thing was an ARGUMENT, not a capability: boosting.py fuses a
    vocabulary into that decoder's greedy loop.

    So the field is honoured everywhere, in every half the engine has:

      Whisper    the terms are joined into the decoder's hotwords, unchanged,
                 AND compiled into this request's repair rules.
      Parakeet   the terms are compiled into this request's repair rules
                 always, and into a decode-time boosting automaton when the
                 request added boost=true. `accepts_vocabulary` is now TRUE
                 here and /health reports it — the flag is a claim about the
                 DECODER, and the decoder changed.

    The two halves recover different failures and it is worth keeping them
    apart: repair fixes a word the model HEARD and spelled wrong; biasing can
    recover one it never approached, at the cost of firing on audio the terms
    are absent from. That cost is why the second half is opt-in — see _boost.

    Nothing here is accepted and dropped, but "honoured" is not the same as
    "did something", and the difference is worth being exact about because this
    module's whole rule turns on it. A term reaches every mechanism the engine
    has. Two shapes then produce no rule on purpose — an all-lower-case term
    and one under three characters, both of which would rewrite correct text;
    glossary.term_rules argues each. What a term actually DID is answered by
    X-Glossary-Repaired, which names the terms that rewrote something and is
    absent when none did, so a caller can tell the two apart per request rather
    than by reading this docstring.

    The ceiling is profiles.MAX_ENTRIES for profiles.py's reason and not a
    fresh one: every term becomes a compiled regex run over every word of the
    transcript, and a paste accident should not make one request slow in a way
    nobody connects to the paste.

    surface had no way to: the native body carries `repaired`, and a client
    here could not tell a transcript the glossary had touched from one it had
    not. A header rather than a body key because ADR 0001 forbids an extension
    changing the response shape, and because the shape differs per
    response_format anyway — `text`, `srt` and `vtt` have nowhere to put a key.
    `x-stt-engine` already sets the precedent on this surface.

    `x-boost-applied` answers the same question for the other half, and it is
    not decoration. A term sent with boost=true can fail to reach the decoder
    for three different reasons — no piece for one of its characters, under
    STT_BOOST_MIN_PHRASE_CHARS, over STT_BOOST_MAX_PHRASES — and only the first
    of those is a 400. Without this header the other two are exactly the silent
    drop the rest of this module refuses to commit. Present only when something
    was boosted, so its absence means the decoder saw no vocabulary.

    PERCENT-ENCODED UTF-8, comma-separated. Starlette encodes a header value as
    latin-1, so a repaired term is a 500 waiting for the first deployment whose
    vocabulary is not Western European — `日本語` is a perfectly good glossary
    entry and cannot be a raw header value. quote() with a space left safe
    keeps the ordinary ASCII case byte-identical to the term itself, and it
    escapes a comma inside a term to %2C so the separator stays unambiguous.

    Absent when nothing fired, so the header's presence means something.
