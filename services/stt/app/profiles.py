"""Named glossary profiles: what is loaded, from where, and who may write it.

A glossary is a **named profile**, selected per request. Nothing is applied
unless a request asks for it, which is the opposite of what this service did
until now — `pipeline.start` read one file at boot, compiled it into
`state["rules"]`, and applied it to every transcript for the life of the
container.

WHY THE SET IS NOT ONE LIST ANY MORE
------------------------------------
Two separate failures, and only one of them is obvious.

**The list was one person's vocabulary inside a public artefact.**
`services/stt/glossary.txt` shipped `catalaxy = Catallaxy`,
`theory dashboard = Theoria dashboard` and `ghost paper = Ghost Pepper` into an
image published to a public registry under a BSD licence. Anyone who pulled it
got those rewrites applied to their own audio, naming projects they have never
heard of, discoverable only by reading the image.

**And an irrelevant term is not free.** Measured across 25 cells: a
glossary whose terms do NOT occur in the audio raised WER by **28% on Whisper
and 28% on Whisper**. That measurement is the whole argument for small opt-in
profiles. If an unused term cost nothing, one big always-on list would be fine
— and it is also why selecting several profiles at once is discouraged in the
README for a measured reason rather than a tidiness one.

WHERE PROFILES COME FROM
------------------------
Three sources, and which one a profile came from is visible in the API rather
than implied:

    builtin   STT_GLOSSARY_BUILTIN, /etc/calliope/glossaries in the image.
              Read-only. PUT or DELETE on one of these names is a 409, never a
              silent shadow: a profile whose contents depend on which directory
              won is a profile nobody can reason about.
    custom    STT_GLOSSARY_DIR, /glossaries, a mounted volume. Writable over
              the API. If nothing is mounted there the write routes answer 503
              naming the reason and the built-ins still serve — a deployment
              that mounted nowhere to persist has said, by omission, that it
              does not want run-time profiles, and accepting a PUT that
              evaporates on restart would be worse than refusing it. Same
              reasoning as the UI's clips.writable().
    env       STT_GLOSSARY, one file named by the operator, registered under
              its own stem. It is the pre-profile variable, kept working
              because a deployment that set it should not silently lose its
              vocabulary — but it is a profile now like any other, opted into
              per request rather than applied to everything.

RELOADING WITHOUT A RESTART
---------------------------
Per-request selection is meaningless while the set is frozen at boot, so the
registry rescans when the files change. The stamping is `voices.py`'s, with one
deliberate difference: that file stamps only the DIRECTORY (st_mtime_ns and
st_ino), because a voice clip arrives as a whole new file and a directory's
mtime changes when an entry is created, renamed or removed. A glossary is a
text file somebody edits IN PLACE with an editor, which does not touch the
directory's mtime at all, so each known file is stat()ed too. That is a couple
of extra stat() calls against a request that spends seconds in a recogniser.

st_ino is in the stamp for `voices.py`'s reason: a volume can be swapped under a
running container — remounted, or replaced by a deploy — and the new
directory's mtime can plausibly be older than the one we recorded.

    """Is this left-hand side a shape that can eat a correct sentence?

    The rule is: **a single-word left-hand side needs `force`.** That is the
    `belly` case, which the shipped glossary's own header has argued since long
    before this module — "Belli" is heard as "belly", but a `belly = Belli`
    rule corrupts any sentence that genuinely says belly.

    WHAT THIS IS NOT, stated plainly because the gap matters. It is not a
    dictionary lookup. There is no word list in a python:3.13-slim image, and
    the two ways of getting one were both worse than this:

      * an apt package (`wamerican`, ~1 MB) to answer a question asked a few
        times a day, in an image whose Containerfile installs exactly one apt
        package and says why;
      * an embedded list of the commonest few thousand words, which would not
        contain "belly" — it sits around rank 4000 — and so would confidently
        pass the one case the check exists for. A check that misses its own
        motivating example is worse than a blunt one, because it is trusted.

    So the check over-refuses instead: `catalaxy = Catallaxy` is not an English
    word and is refused anyway, and `force` accepts it in one flag with the
    reason printed. Over-refusal is recoverable; a corrupted transcript is
    discovered weeks later, if ever.

    It also under-refuses, and the rejection message says so. A multi-word
    left-hand side is NOT automatically safe — "my sequel = MySQL" and
    "red is = Redis" would both eat ordinary sentences — but nothing local to
    the rule can see that, and pretending otherwise would be the same false
    confidence as the word list.
