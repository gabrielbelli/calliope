"""Wire-format helpers only. An optional extra: voice-common[audio].

Three small things, each of which is either already duplicated byte for byte
or missing from a service that needs it.

An extra rather than a core dependency for two reasons. stt-stack needs none
of it and should not take numpy just to import the auth module. And numpy is
the one pin that genuinely conflicts across the estate: tts-stack pins
2.3.4, and tts-long deliberately leaves it unpinned because chatterbox-tts
requires numpy<2 on Python 3.12, so a hard dependency here would make one of
the two resolves impossible.

Everything above the wire format stays out. The ffmpeg table and its bitrate
reasoning — 32k opus, 64k mp3 and aac, chosen for one voice at 24 kHz — is an
image decision, not a wire decision. tts-stack and tts-long agree on those
numbers today and still keep a table each: tts-stack's formats are fixed at
import, tts-long's are whatever ffmpeg on PATH allows at start-up, and
stt-stack encodes nothing at all so that a 44.1 kHz caller is told rather than
quietly resampled.
